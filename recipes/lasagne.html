    <h3><p>Hello there, this is a recipe for lasagne!!!</p></h3>

    <h4>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced
            </li>
            <li>
           ½ cup diced carrot
            </li> 
            <li>
             ½ cup diced celery

            </li>
            <li>
            ½ cup diced yellow onion

            </li>
            <li>
             1 tablespoon olive oil
            </li>
            <li>
             7 ounces ground beef
            </li>
           
        </ul>


        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has</p>
                <p>rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir</p>
                <p>until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring</p>
                <p>and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
            <li>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir gently and cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
            <li>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as much water and possible; reserve the liquid. Puree spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
            <li>Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the center; add eggs, spinach, and about 1 tablespoon of the reserved liquid. Mix together by hand or using the dough hook of a stand mixer, adding more liquid if needed. Knead until dough becomes a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
